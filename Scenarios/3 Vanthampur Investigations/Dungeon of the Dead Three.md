## Secrets and Clues

- **Questioning Mortlock**: In exchange for sparing his life, Mortlock will betray [[Trafficking Amrik]] and tell the adventurers that Amrik was giving the Cult of the Dead Three the names of who to target.
- **Assassin’s Orders**: The assassin targeting Mortlock carries a note with instructions from [[Trafficking Amrik]]. The assassin could also be questioned to similar effect.
- **Vanthampur Boys**: Knowing that one or more Vanthampur heirs are involved can be enough to trigger an investigation of [[Vanthampur Manor]] all by itself.
- **Mortlock’s Correspondence**: A letter from his mother detailing how to access the dungeons beneath the bathhouse. Mortlock can be questioned to similar effect leading to [[Vanthampur Manor]].
- **Missives of the Hidden Lord**: Correspondence from Thavius Kreeg, passing on instructions from Gargauth to the Dead Three leaders (and inadvertently revealing its presence in [[Vanthampur Manor]]).
- **Missives of the Hidden Lord**: The missives also mention the [[Infernal Puzzlebox]].
- **Questioning Mortlock**: Mortlock knows that a powerful cult leader escaped from Elturel just before its fall and that his mother is protecting him in the basement of Vanthampur Manor. The cult leader brought two powerful artifacts with him, one of which was locked in a box (or maybe the box is the artifact? Mortlock isn’t sure), the [[Infernal Puzzlebox]].
