# Alan Alyth

## Appearance
Owner of the Elfsong Tavern, male neutral half elf commoner. Unattractive and overweight by half elf standards.

## Quote / Framework
“Are we overlooking the possibility she may be attracted to me?”
Based on Xander from Buffy the Vampire Slayer

## Role Playing
- Generally likeable, but nobody's love interest.
- Say things like "I think it's very possible that..."
- Pretend to be washing glasses behind the bar

## Background
Alan recently turned seventy-five years old and has run the establishment for decades. His elven blood through his half-elf mother has kept him alive this long, and keeps him looking better than most full-blooded humans his age. He runs a moneylending business on the side, offering loans to customers he trusts. He rarely gives loans to adventurers, knowing how flighty they can be, but he might offer them a free glass of elverquisst wine if he thinks it’ll keep their swords sheathed (.
