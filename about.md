These are my notes for running Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus.

I am in the process of merging the official module, the Alexandrian remix, and the Lazy DM's approach to make it easier for me to run it the way I like it.

This website is mostly so I can share my progress with a fellow DM who is running the same campaign in parallel.

If you'd like to get started, you can go directly to [[Descent into Avernus]].

Some of the resource I used to create this site are

- [Official Module](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia) on D&D Beyond.
- [The Alexandrian Remix](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/44214/roleplaying-games/remixing-avernus)
- [The Lazy DM](https://slyflourish.com/lazydm/)
- [Paul Jacobson's](https://pauljacobson.me/2021/02/05/how-i-use-obsidian-for-dungeons-and-dragons-games/) notes for using Obsidian.
- [Obsidian.md](http://obsidian.md) is the tool I use for writing my notes in markdown.
- [notenote.link](https://notenote.link/notes/obsidian-integration) is what most of my jekyll template is based on and does most of the heavy lifting of formatting the pages.
- Maxime Vaillancourt's [Digital Garden Jekyll Template](https://digital-garden-jekyll-template.netlify.app/) has a few very handy items I'm using, particularly the node map.
- [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) is a good site for free graphics.
- [Github](http://github.com) for hosting the web site.
