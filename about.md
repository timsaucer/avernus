These are my notes for running Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus.

I am in the process of merging the official module, the Alexandrian remix, and the Lazy DM's approach to make it easier for me to run it the way I like it.

This website is mostly so I can share my progress with a fellow DM who is running the same campaign in parallel.

If you'd like to get started, you can go direclty to [[Descent into Avernus]].
