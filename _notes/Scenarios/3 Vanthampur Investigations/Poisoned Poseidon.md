The Poisoned Poseidon is a beached pirate ship turned tannery that is being used to conduct murders of the Refugees from Elturel. It does have a legitimate business, but the Cult of the Dead Three is operating out of here as well.

## Strong Start

Rumors of how the _Poisoned Poseidon_, the pirate ship scourge of the Sword Coast, came to be perched so far inland vary. Common to most of the myths are the ideas that it was an infernal warlock captain who decided no one would ever sit at her helm after he died and used evil magic to place it there. Regardless, there are still those who say that on still nights you can hear the cries of the children orphaned by her dark past.

- One of aft cabins is meeting room that contains **Poseidon Correspondence**.
- All cabins are empty.

### Lower Deck
- Mostly stores the untreated skins of slaughtered cattle that are delivered to the tannery
- Strewn with the blood, dirt, manure, hooves, and horns that come with hides.

Creatures to contend with:
- 2 [Commoners ](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/commoner) working on cleaning some hides.

### Lower Deck Cabins
- The aft cabins are used as sleeping quarters for the murder squad.

- The larger fore cabin contains three small shrines, one dedicated to each of the Dead Three.

- 2 [Necromites](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/creatures#CultistsoftheDeadThree)

### Hold
- The forward chamber is a work floor where skins are trimmed.
- The aft chamber has huge vats. Here skins are sprinkled with urine or soaked in an alkaline solution of wood ash and lime before being folded, hair-side in, and taken down to the Lower Hold.

Creatures to contend with:
- [Reaper of Bhaal](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/creatures#CultistsoftheDeadThree)
- 4 [Commoners ](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/commoner) working at the vats

### Lower Hold
- The lower hold is studded with wooden racks on which treated hides are spread.
- Special knives, which hang on the walls, are used to scrape the hair off one side and whatever flesh remains on the other.
- Several huge vats are then used for washing: A solution of pigeon droppings or dog shit removes the lime.
- In the center of the Lower Hold is a table. Shohreh Netitia’s corpse lays there.
- A side table contains a disturbing variety of surgical instruments and three brands (each with the holy symbol of one of the Dead Three). The _Poseidon Papers_ handout can be found amidst these instruments and Shohreh Netitia’s refugee papers can be found among her personal effects.

Creatures to contend with:
- [Master of Souls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/creatures#CultistsoftheDeadThree) (Remigio) working on the body

### Lower Hold Catacombs
- The various niches lining the catacomb halls are stacked with urine-soaked skins (they are kept here until the rotting hair has loosened).
- The four iron doors lead to small cells where prisoners are held to various purpose.
- Three victims are locked up - take the rest of the names from the victim list in [[Investigating the Murders]].

Creatures to conted with:
- [2 Fists of Bane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/creatures#CultistsoftheDeadThree) guarding cells 

## Secrets and Clues

- **Poseidon Correspondence**: Reports from the Dead Three leadership mention the bathhouse leading to the [[Dungeon of the Dead Three]].
- **Poseidon Papers**:  DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) test reveals the papers to be forgeries. The forgery can also be detected if the PCs look to verify the origin of the papers. See the papers on the [Alexandrian remix](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/44406/roleplaying-games/remixing-avernus-part-3e-the-poisoned-poseidon).
- **Poseidon Cultists**: Following or questioning Poseidon cultists can lead to the bathhouse and the [[Dungeon of the Dead Three]].

## Potential Treasure

- Nothing of value besides 4d6 gp among all the bodies.
