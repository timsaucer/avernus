The Poisoned Poseidon is a beached pirate ship turned tannery that is being used to conduct murders of the Refugees from Elturel. It does have a legitimate business, but the Cult of the Dead Three is operating out of here as well.

## Strong Start

Rumors of how the _Poisoned Poseidon_, the pirate ship scourge of the Sword Coast, came to be perched so far inland vary. Common to most of the myths are the ideas that it was an infernal warlock captain who decided no one would ever sit at her helm after he died and used evil magic to place it there. Regardless, there are still those who say that on still nights you can hear the cries of the children orphaned by her dark past.
