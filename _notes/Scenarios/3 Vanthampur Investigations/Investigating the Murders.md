## Secrets and Clues

- **Tanner’s Fluid**: One of the victims has an alkaline solution of wood ash and lime staining her clothes, an alchymical used to rotten and loosen the hair of hides. (The nearest tannery is the [[Poisoned Poseidon]].)
- **Staking Out the Murder Scene**: When the next corpse is dumped, the PCs can follow the murderers back to the [[Poisoned Poseidon]] or question them.
- **Refugee Papers**: Forged refugee paperwork found at the murder scene and on bodies in the morgue can be traced back to [[Trafficking Amrik]].
- **Canvassing Victims**: Those who knew the victims can report that they’d been smuggled into the city by [[Trafficking Amrik]].
- **Questioning Killers**: If the PCs stakeout Insight Park, they can question the cultists dumping the bodies who tell them they work out of the [[Dungeon of the Dead Three]].
