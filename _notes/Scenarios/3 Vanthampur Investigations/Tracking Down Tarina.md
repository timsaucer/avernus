## Scenes

- Entering the [[Elfsong Tavern]] while the Elfsong is being sung. [[Tarina]] isn’t there yet. Use the Elfsong Tavern location to describe the scene. They can interact with some NPCs or just move straight on to the next scene.
- [[Alan Alyth]] comes over to ask them to deal with the deadbeat Oshalla.
	- While the PCs are waiting for Tarina to show up, Alan Alyth comes over to their table.
	- He’s seen the Flaming Fist badges they’re wearing and he’d like their help.
	- He has a tenant renting a room upstairs who has fallen behind on her rent. She’s locked her door and refuses to come out.
	- Do not use deadly force.
	- This reinforces their new role as members of the Flaming Fist.
- Refugee enters, desperate for lodging.
	- They plead to PCs to help.
	- Locals want them to leave. (Some mixed reactions).
- Tarina arrives.
	- Elfsong again.
	- Alan points her out in exchange for the help they gave.
	- Tarina briefs the PCs: She’s seen Dead Three cultists around the [[Poisoned Poseidon]] in the Brampton docks, but she's sure that is not their main headquarters.
- Elfsong changes: See the notes on the offiical page. [The Lay of Elturel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/a-tale-of-two-cities#Elfsong)

## Secrets and Clues

- Alan Alyth, the owner of the tavern, might tell about his grandmother, Lady Alyth Eldendara, heard the song just once and bought the tavern that very night. The former owner agreed only on the condition that he would always have a seat in the tavern where he could come each night to listen to the song. Theomon’s Chair still sits in the corner, sacrosanct and unused by any patron.
- A first-timer breaks down into tears upon hearing the song is usually embraced and comforted by the nearest regular patron.
- NPCs should spread more [[Rumors of Elturel]]. Some are anti-refugees and some want to help them.
- Tarina has seen the cultists around the [[Poisoned Poseidon]] in the Brampton Docks.
