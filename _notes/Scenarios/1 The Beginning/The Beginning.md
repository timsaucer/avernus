## Strong Start
(Refugees along the road version of Alexandrian).

It has been four long days since the city of Elturel suddenly vanished from the Earth, leaving everyone wondering what truly happened. So far you've avoided mixing with any of the other refugees from Elturel, but their numbers increase day by day.

## Scenes

### Bandits attack
As you break the crest of the next hill you see a small family on the side of the road. 1 of 5 gruff looking thugs are is in the middle of beating upon the father.
### Refugee campground
As night begins to fall, you approach a large campfire. Somber faces around the group talk in hushed tones as they share what little food the have among each other.
### Flaming Fist roughing up refugees
Ahead on the road you see three well armored people yelling at a family of refugees. As you get closer, you hear them berating the family and telling them to go away from Baldur's Gate.
### Zodge's Deal
Flame Zodge sizes up the adventurers and offers them a deal:
-   The city is in chaos. Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard is missing; presumed dead in the fall of Elturel. (He could mention a few [[Rumors of Elturel]].
-   Some people blame the Elturians; others think the refugees have a secret agenda; tensions are high, violence is everywhere, and the Flaming Fist is stretched thin trying to keep the city from falling apart.
-   Someone is killing refugees. Zodge thinks it’s a coordinated effort, but the Flaming Fist doesn’t have the manpower to mount proper investigation or response.
-   If the PCs agree to investigate the murders and bring the perpetrators to justice, he will immediately allow the refugees from their caravan to enter the city.
-   Beyond that, the refugees will be on their own: They’ll have to make whatever arrangements they can. (But it will certainly be better than the refugee camp outside, where conditions are getting more desperate every day.)
Once they agree to the deal give them additional information:
-   A half dozen bodies have been dumped in Insight Park, located in the Brampton neighborhood south of Cliffgate.
-   Ritual symbols associated with the Dead Three – the gods Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul – have been carved into the bodies. Zodge isn’t sure if it’s _actually_ followers of the Dead Three or if someone is just using them as a scapegoat.
-   The PCs are authorized, as deputies, to kill whoever is responsible on sight.
-   A Flaming Fist informant named Tarina has sent word to Zodge that she has a lead on the killings. The PCs are to meet at the Elfsong Tavern tonight, find out what she knows, and then follow up on whatever lead she has.
-   Zodge gives them a bag with 50gp to pay Tarina for the information.
-   They should keep him apprised of their progress.

## Secrets and Clues

- In each of the discussions with NPCs ensure you spread some of the [[Rumors of Elturel]]. They do not need to be consistent.
- Flaming Fist is roughing up refugees and want them out of Baldur's Gate (not our problem).

## Fantastic Locations

### Bandit Attack
- Single horse drawn cart off to the side of the road with kids hiding behind it.
- Fallen log across the road that forced them to stop.
- Pathway into the woods the leading to the bandit's camp.

### Campground
- Bonfire with logs set up around it and people singing songs
- Teenagers playing a game of Baldur's Bones until a parent breaks them up
- Old couple sitting around a secondary fire cooking stew and discussing Elturel.

### Outside Baldur's Gate
- Makeshift refugee camp of tents loosely scattered around the outside of the city wall.
- Gates are barred with two guards outside and two towers on either side with lookouts. They can see the emblem of the Flaming Fist on many of these guards.
- Some carts with food are being allowed in, but the refugees are starting to run out and quickly ask for anything newcomers have to offer.
