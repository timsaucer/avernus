## Scenes

### Zodge's Deal
Flame Zodge sizes up the adventurers and offers them a deal:
-   The city is in chaos. Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard is missing; presumed dead in the fall of Elturel. (He could mention a few [[Rumors of Elturel]].
-   Some people blame the Elturians; others think the refugees have a secret agenda; tensions are high, violence is everywhere, and the Flaming Fist is stretched thin trying to keep the city from falling apart.
-   Someone is killing refugees. Zodge thinks it’s a coordinated effort, but the Flaming Fist doesn’t have the manpower to mount proper investigation or response.
-   If the PCs agree to investigate the murders and bring the perpetrators to justice, he will immediately allow the refugees from their caravan to enter the city.
-   Beyond that, the refugees will be on their own: They’ll have to make whatever arrangements they can. (But it will certainly be better than the refugee camp outside, where conditions are getting more desperate every day.)
Once they agree to the deal give them additional information:
-   A half dozen bodies have been dumped in Insight Park, located in the Brampton neighborhood south of Cliffgate.
-   Ritual symbols associated with the Dead Three – the gods Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul – have been carved into the bodies. Zodge isn’t sure if it’s _actually_ followers of the Dead Three or if someone is just using them as a scapegoat.
-   The PCs are authorized, as deputies, to kill whoever is responsible on sight.
-   A Flaming Fist informant named Tarina has sent word to Zodge that she has a lead on the killings. The PCs are to meet at the Elfsong Tavern tonight, find out what she knows, and then follow up on whatever lead she has.
-   Zodge gives them a bag with 50gp to pay Tarina for the information.
-   They should keep him apprised of their progress.

## Fantastic Locations

### Outside Baldur's Gate
- Makeshift refugee camp of tents loosely scattered around the outside of the city wall.
- Gates are barred with two guards outside and two towers on either side with lookouts. They can see the emblem of the Flaming Fist on many of these guards.
- Some carts with food are being allowed in, but the refugees are starting to run out and quickly ask for anything newcomers have to offer.
