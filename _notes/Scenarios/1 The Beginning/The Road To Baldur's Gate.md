## Strong Start

(Refugees along the road version of Alexandrian).

It has been four long days since the city of Elturel suddenly vanished from the Earth, leaving everyone wondering what truly happened. So far you've avoided mixing with any of the other refugees from Elturel, but their numbers increase day by day.

## Scenes

- **Bandits attack**: As you break the crest of the next hill you see a small family on the side of the road. 1 of 5 gruff looking thugs are is in the middle of beating upon the father. See [[#Bandit Attack]].
- **Refugee campground**: As night begins to fall, you approach a large campfire. Somber faces around the group talk in hushed tones as they share what little food the have among each other. See [[#Campground]]
	- Be sure to indicate that food is running scare.
- **Flaming Fist roughing up refugees**: Ahead on the road you see three well armored people yelling at a family of refugees. As you get closer, you hear them berating the family and telling them to go away from Baldur's Gate.
	- There should be 1 more Flaming Fist [[Veteran]] than the number of PCs.
	- Make sure the PCs understand they are outnumbered and outmatched.
	- The Flaming Fists don't want to kill anyone in plain sight, so this is not a battle to the death.


## Secrets and Clues
