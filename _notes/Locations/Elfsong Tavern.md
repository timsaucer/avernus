## General Description
- 40x50 ft main room with a number of private rooms of to either side.
- Lighting: Firelight from large fire in the hearth to the right plus candles on the tables give shadows and places to discuss unnoticed.
- Senses
    - Sight: [See aspects below.](#aspects)
    - Sound: General clatter of talk among patrons except it becomes silent when the Elfong plays.
    - Feel: Floor is sticky from years of neglect and spilled ale.
    - Smell / Taste: Tale ale and suprisingly good mean roasting in the back.
- Events: A handful of people are playing Baldur's Bones at the tables.
- Mood: Deep emotions stir in you at the sound of the meloncoly Elfsong when it plays earily throughout the building.

## Aspects

- Flanking the entrance are two bouncers: a suit of [animated armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/animated-armor) called Klank and a gruff female [half-ogre](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/half-ogre) named Skoona.
- To the far side is a private dining room. This room is called the Green Dragon Room for the mounted head of a young green dragon that hangs on the south wall.
- The disembodied voice of a female elf fills the tavern with a melancholy song, giving the establishment its name. The ballad isnâ€™t loud enough to disrupt conversation, but most patrons stop speaking when the elfsong begins, then resume only after it ends.

## Key Info
- This is one of the less deadly bars in Baldur's Gate.
- Players should come here when [[Tracking Down Tarina]].
