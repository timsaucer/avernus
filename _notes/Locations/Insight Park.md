## [General Description](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/bgdia/baldurs-gate-gazetteer#LowerCityGazetteer)
- A large portion of a steep hill
- Natural lighting, depending on the time of day
	- Eternal Flame torches set up around the Drawing Tree [see Aspects](#aspects)
- Senses
    - Sight: [see Aspects](#aspects)
    - Sound: Squirrels skitter among the branches and bushes. There is the background noise of the city, but the park is mostly quiet.
    - Feel: The ground is soft and has a spring to it, making your steps more careful as you move forward.
    - Smell / Taste: The air is alive with the scents of pine and blossoming flowers. You detect a whiff of lilac.
- Events
    - The area is empty, but if they search they can find **Torimesh the Druid** (see [[Investigating the Murders]]) who converted this dump into a park. He is tending a garden when they see him.
    - 3 eternal flame torches are set up around the Drawing Tree, drawing your gaze (think: tiki torches)
- Mood: The area is peaceful among the crime and chaos of the city, except you then notice the dead body breaking up the mood.

## Aspects
- Crushed stone walkwalks create meandering paths among the trees and bushes.
- There is a small fountain with a dwarf statue holding their hammer high. Water shoots from the hammer. If characters drink this water they feel refreshed (it can remove one level of exhaustion once per long rest).
- The Drawing Tree is a species nobody can identify. When **Torimesh** entices it, a sheet of bark will peel off with a prophetic vision for the adventurers.

## Key Info
- Bodies were dumped here during the [[Vanthampur Investigations]] where refugees were being killed. Players come here during [[Investigating the Murders]].
