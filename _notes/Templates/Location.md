    -     What type of source is it coming from (torches/sunlight/magic/braziers/etc), and how many sources are there?
    -     How bright (darkness, dim light, comfortable, painfully bright)?
    -     Is the light steady or flickering?
- Senses
    - Sight
        - Use the aspects below
    - Sound
        -     What sounds are there, if any?
        -     Is there a single noise or is it, rather, a cacophony coming from multiple sources?
        -     How loud are the sounds?
        -     Is there an obvious source?
        -     If not, then what direction are the sounds coming from?
    - Feel
        - The ground has a spring to it, making your steps more careful as you move forward.
        - You feel a gust of wind pushing from deeper within the cavern.
        - As you run your hand over the castle wall, you feel the fine sand between your fingers indicating it has not been disturbed for a very long time.
    - Smell / Taste
        - Acrid chemicals burning your nostrils
        - Sweet flowers and fresh air
        - Stale beer and urine
- Events
    - Are there any living creatures or NPCs?
    - The easiest way to include an event is by having the NPC/creature interacting with the environment in some manner. It could be people playing cards in the corner or a goblin king looking over his treasure horde.
    - If not, are there any inanimate objects doing anything?
    - This could be natural features (waterfalls cascading), or manmade object (clock chiming, gears mechanically shifting around)
- Mood
    - You canâ€™t help but feel a sense of urgency in the air.
    - Upon entering the new room, a wave of relaxation and calmness rushes over you.
    - As you notice the decomposing remains in the corner, a cold shiver runs up your spine.
