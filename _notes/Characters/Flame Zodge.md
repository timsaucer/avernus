# Flame Zodge
Written as Captain Zodge but the Flaming Fist doesn't have captains.

## Appearance
Leader of the Flaming Fist; A tall man with long black hair and a leather eye patch

## Quote / Framework
“It's in the freaking city”

## Role Playing
- Base this on Saul Tigh from Battlestar Galactica
- Disgusted by nearly everything he hears.
- Keep lip pursed as if waiting to hear something bad

## Background
Although Zodge lacks common decency, he cares for the well-being of the soldiers who serve under his command. Angry mobs can be dangerous, and Zodge is quick to take out the instigators so that the mob’s anger turns to fear quickly. Responds to bribes of at least 10 gp.
